# Turtle Pico - Making electronics work easier and more widely

![Turtle Pico](board/main/pic/PXL_20240507_160146261.jpg)

The Turtle Pico Board which looks like a turtle, uses connectors on the board for easy connection to components. The board is equipped with Raspberry Pi Pico W, and programming is easy with Micropython.

When you want to build something, just buy the components and plug them into this board! That's all there is to wiring. Then all you have to do is write the programming.

Don't know how to program? Don't worry. You can find some programming examples in the official repository.
